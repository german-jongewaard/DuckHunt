# DuckHunt
Duck Hunt is a shooter game in which the objective is to shoot moving targets on the mobile screen in mid-flight. The game is played from a first-person perspective, which the player presses with his finger and shoots the screen.

Features:
- Designed and built for Android, it looks and feels at home on your device.
- It connects with the Firebase service and stores the player's name and score, and then shows it in a ranking.
